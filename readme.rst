SideCar Locals
##############

This is a global minor mode that provides a flexible alternative to Emacs built-in ``dir-locals`` functionality.

Available via `melpa <https://melpa.org/#/sidecar-locals>`__.


Motivation
==========

The motivation for sidecar-locals is to conveniently configure projects without being limited to changing variables.

The main differences between this package and ``dir-locals`` are:

Code Execution
   Unlike dir-locals which requires ``(eval ...)`` blocks which need to be explicitly trusted.

   This package runs the emacs-lisp directly,
   since trust is manged at the path level instead of individual variables.

   While both methods are valid, executing code directly is more convenient when the code contains project-level logic
   (where every change to the code doesn't require re-trusting, continually growing the ``custom.el`` file).

Out of Source Configuration
   Support for configuration outside the project's root directly.

   Similar to out-of-source builds, this package supports out-of-source locals so your source repository
   can be kept pristine and your configuration can be stored and versioned separately.

   This is useful since storing personal configuration in ``dir-locals.el`` may not be appropriate for larger projects.

   Having local ``dir-locals.el`` files scattered around the source directory can be inconvenient:

   - These files can't be versioned conveniently.
   - Operations such as bisecting or switching branches are complicated when
     directories that would be removed contain files not tracked by a version control system.

An example of what the directory layout might look like where ``/src/my-project`` and ``/src/other-project/`` are two
version controlled repositories:

.. code-block::

   /src/
   /src/my-project/
   /src/other-project/
   /src/.sidecar-locals/
   /src/.sidecar-locals/my-project(c-mode).el
   /src/.sidecar-locals/other-project(python-mode).el

In this example the ``/src/`` directory would have to be added to ``sidecar-locals-paths-allow``.


Usage
=====

- Install the package and enable the global mode with ``(sidecar-locals-mode)``.
- Create a ``.sidecar-locals`` directory in the projects root (this may be above the version control root)
  for out-of-source locals.

- Add this path to ``sidecar-locals-paths-allow`` (including the trailing slash).

- Open a file where you would like locals to apply and run ``sidecar-locals-report``.

  This will print a list of files which would be used if found for the current buffer.

- Create one of more of these files, then reload the current buffer for the locals to be detected and applied.


Customization
-------------

``sidecar-locals-ignore-modes`` (nil)
   Major modes that disable ``sidecar-mode``.

``sidecar-locals-paths-allow`` (nil)
   A list of strings, each string should be a directory that contains a ``.sidecar-locals`` directory.

   - The trailing slash is needed on each path.
   - A directory and all it's subdirectories can be matched by adding a ``*`` to the end.
   - Support expanding ``~`` prefix to the HOME directory.

   Example:

   .. code-block:: elisp

      (setq sidecar-locals-paths-allow
            (list "/my/repositories/project/"
                  "/my/personal/projects/*"
                  "~/other_project/*"))

``sidecar-locals-paths-deny`` (nil)
   Paths to disallow, setting this suppresses warnings when untrusted paths are found.
   This uses the same format as ``sidecar-locals-paths-allow``.

``sidecar-locals-ignore-buffer`` (nil)
   When non-nil, ``sidecar-locals`` wont be used for this buffer,
   when this is a callable, it will be called with the current buffer,
   a nil return value is used to disable.

``sidecar-locals-dir-name`` (``.sidecar-locals``)
   The subdirectory to search for when detecting local settings.


Macros
------

``sidecar-locals-root``
   A convenience macro that expands to the directory associates with the sidecar-locals file being executed.
   A trailing slash is ensured.

   This will typically be your projects top-level directory.
   The macro is for convenience as it's often unnecessarily involved to compute this value.
   Using this macro avoids having to reference absolute, hard-coded paths within your configuration.
   Or having to search for the projects top-level directory.


Details
-------

- Multiple ``.sidecar-locals`` paths are supported.

- Multiple major-modes are supported (so ``c-mode`` will detect both ``c-mode`` and ``prog-mode``).

- The execution order of locals is always least to most specific.

  - Top-level locals are executed before those found further down the directory hierarchy.
  - Derived modes such as ``prog-mode`` are executed before the major-mode that derived from them.

  This is done so it's possible to setup generic settings that can be overridden by more specific locations & modes.

- Nested sub-directories in ``.sidecar-locals`` are supported,
  you may mirror the directory structure of your project if you need subdirectories to have their own configuration.

  For example:

  .. code-block::

     /src/
     /src/my-project/
     /src/my-project/external/
     /src/.sidecar-locals/
     /src/.sidecar-locals/my-project(c-mode).el
     /src/.sidecar-locals/my-project/external(c-mode).el

- This package doesn't conflict with ``dir-locals`` (which run beforehand).


Security
--------

Since running code directly has security implications, here are some suggestions for how to use this package safely.

For public projects it's recommended to create ``.sidecar-locals`` above the projects version control root,
and only trust that directory.

This way any ``.sidecar-locals`` directories committed into the project will be detected and reported as untrusted
(without running any code).

For personal projects when you aren't concerned someone else creating a ``.sidecar-locals`` directory
you may add ``.sidecar-locals`` anywhere in the project,
recursively trusting the projects root using the ``*`` path suffix.


Tips
----

Deferred Loading
   When setting options for packages, you may want to add each configuration in a
   ``(with-eval-after-load 'name-of-package ...)`` block.

   This avoids any problems caused by the configuration running before the package is loaded.

Share Logic Between Modes
   Having two or more modes share logic can be done by creating a file and pointing both the major modes to this file.

   .. code-block:: elisp

      ;; Shared code for C-like languages.
      (let ((path (file-name-directory load-file-name)))
        (load (concat path "my_project(c-mode-generic).el") :nomessage t))

   The contents above can be written to:
   ``my_project(c-mode).el``, ``my_project(c++-mode).el`` and ``my_project(objc-mode).el``.

   Any mode specific logic can be added into these file as needed.
