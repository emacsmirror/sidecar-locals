;;; Commentary:

;; Side Car Locals supports out-of-source locals,
;; in a way that makes it easy to manage locals for a project
;; without having to keep track of files inside your project,
;; which may not be in version control.
;; This means your local code can be conveniently versioned separately.
;;
;; Besides this, there are some other differences with the built-in `dir-locals'.
;;
;; - Trust is managed by paths with
;;   `sidecar-locals-paths-allow' and `sidecar-locals-paths-deny'.
;; - The files are evaluated instead of looking up individual variables.
;; - It's up to the scripts to set local variables e.g. `setq-local',
;;   and avoid changes to the global state in a way that might cause unexpected behavior.
;;

;;; Usage

;;
;; Write the following code to your .emacs file:
;;
;;   (require 'sidecar-locals)
;;   (sidecar-locals-mode)
;;   (setq sidecar-locals-paths-allow '("/my/trusted/path/" "/other/path/*"))
;;
;; Or with `use-package':
;;
;;   (use-package sidecar-locals
;;     :config
;;     (setq sidecar-locals-paths-allow '("/my/trusted/path/" "/other/path/*")))
;;   (sidecar-locals-mode)
;;
